In this document, the steps to *tidy* the [World Health Organisation's (WHO)](www.who.int) mortality data for use in R are documented. The following steps are presented.

* Data source: <http://www.who.int/healthinfo/mortality_data/en/>
  + It is assumed that data has been downloaded
* Reading in the WHO mortality data
* Reading the International Classificaion of Diseases data
* Keep the **neoplasm**, **melanoma**, **lymphoma** and **leukaemia** data for ICD10 part 1
  + Tranform the data into long format for the number of deaths
* Transform the population data in long format
* Merge the long population data to the long neoplasm data
  + Care has to be taken with respect to the format of the age groups. 
  + Combine the youngest age groups into a new 0-4 years. 
  + Consider adding an **all** age group category (**not urgent**)
* Calculate the mortality rate per 100,000 population in a new variable
  + rate = (100000*deaths)/pop
* Write a function that will extract data based on country, cause of death, year and sex
  + If any of these are left blank then all the data is extracted
  + A data frame containing the requested data should be returned.
* Next steps will defined later
  * Sumamry graphs
  * Summary tables
  
**Note** There is no not need to use *R Shiny* for this exercise. Only program in this R markdown document.

## Data source

The data was downloaded from <http://www.who.int/healthinfo/mortality_data/en/>. It is assumed that data has been downloaded and resides in a directory "OrigData"

## Reading in the WHO mortality data

The following code will automatically read in the WHO mortality data.
```{r ReadWHOdata, echo=FALSE}
# Load libraries
library(stringr)
library(readr)
library(tibble)

# Set the directory where you have saved the data. 
# This is not a great solution but it works and is easier for the moment, Later it should change.
setwd("OrigData/")

# Select the data files (exclude .zip, .doc, .xls)
csvWHO <- list.files(path=".", full.names = FALSE) %>%
          str_subset("^((?!zip|doc|xls).)*$")

# Use the lapply to read all the data into one list
dataList <- lapply(csvWHO, read_csv, guess_max = min(300000, Inf))

# Extract the data into data.frames (tbl) but start by giving them the dataest you want.
# I convert them to lower case as they are not consistent in the original.
names(dataList) <- str_to_lower(csvWHO) 
list2env(dataList, envir=.GlobalEnv)

# dataList is not longer needed so we will remove it.
rm(dataList)
# Removing the ICD 7, 8, 9 and 10 part 2 data as we will not use them for the moment.
# Also we do not want to have problems with the memory 
rm(morticd7, morticd8, morticd9, morticd10_part2)

# Some garbage collection to free up the memory (although this is something that is
# automatically by kernel). In future we may not need this step.
gc()
```

## Reading the International Classificaion of Diseases data

**Joana:** Please read in the data form the word document here.

```{r readICDdata, echo=TRUE}
library(xml2)

```


### Keep the **neoplasm** data for ICD10 parts 1 

**To do:** Tranform the data into long format for the number of deaths

**Hints:** Use `gather()`, `filter()`, `str_to_upper()` (or an case insensitive regex to select neoplasm data). 

```{r keepNeoplasm, echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)


```



### Transform the population data in long format


```{r popLong, echo=TRUE}

```


### Merging the population data to the neoplasm mortality data

  * Care has to be taken with respect to the format of the age groups. 
  * Combine the youngest age groups into a new 0-4 years. 
  * Consider adding an **all** age group category (**not urgent**)
  * Calculate the mortality rate per 100,000 population in a new variable
    + rate = (100000*deaths)/pop

```{r mortalityPop, echo=TRUE}

```



## Write a function that will extract data based on country, cause of death, year and sex
  * If any of these are left blank then all the data is extracted
  * A data frame containing the requested data should be returned.

```{r}
getWHOdata <- function(country, causes, year, sex){
  # country - Vector of countries to be filtered
  #   cause - Vector of causes of death to be filtered
  #    year - Vector of years to be filtered
  #     sex - Vector of gender to be filtered

}


```


### Next steps

Once the above steps have been completed, the next steps will be defined. They will include:
  * Sumamry graphs
  * Summary tables
